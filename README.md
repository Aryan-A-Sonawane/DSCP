<h1>ðŸ–§ Computer Network Simulation</h1> <br>

<h3>A C-based simulation of a computer network using graphs, demonstrating concepts from data structures such as adjacency lists, Dijkstra's algorithm, and multithreading for simulating data transfer.</h3> <br>
<h4>Features</h4> <br>
1. Add or remove computers (nodes) from the network.
2. Connect computers via routes (edges) with custom latency (weights).
3. View the full network with connection details and packet statistics.
4. Find the shortest path between two computers using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.
5. Simulate data transfer between two nodes with progress output using POSIX threads.
6. Track sent and received packets for each computer.
7. Reset/clear the entire network.

<h4>Technologies Used</h4><br>
C language
POSIX Threads (pthreads)
Windows-specific Sleep function for progress simulation
Adjacency list representation for graphs
Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for pathfinding
