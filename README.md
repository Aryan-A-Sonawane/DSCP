<h1>ðŸ–§ Computer Network Simulation</h1> <br>

<h2>A C-based simulation of a computer network using graphs, demonstrating concepts from data structures such as adjacency lists, Dijkstra's algorithm, and multithreading for simulating data transfer.</h2> <br>
<h3>Features</h3> <br>
1. Add or remove computers (nodes) from the network. <br>
2. Connect computers via routes (edges) with custom latency (weights).  <br>
3. View the full network with connection details and packet statistics. <br>
4. Find the shortest path between two computers using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm. <br>
5. Simulate data transfer between two nodes with progress output using POSIX threads. <br>
6. Track sent and received packets for each computer. <br>
7. Reset/clear the entire network. <br>

<h3>Technologies Used</h3><br>
C language <br>
POSIX Threads (pthreads) <br>
Windows-specific Sleep function for progress simulation <br>
Adjacency list representation for graphs <b4>
